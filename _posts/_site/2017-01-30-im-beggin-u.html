<p>Gentle lines and lullabies
Bittersweet kisses and a slow goodbye
Push me away, but let me stay
All I want, all I need
Something more, someone to please
I’m beggin’ you please</p>

<p>Hear what I have to say
Try hard not to run away
I see myself many years from now
Lost in love I know you don’t know how</p>

<p>If it takes so much to hear me say
I’m sure I’ll find a better way
To tell you what you mean to me
If I try to hard I’m scared you’ll flee
I’m beggin’ you please</p>

<p>Hear what I have to say
I’ll try hard not to lose my way
I see myself tomorrow still loving you
I know it’s hard to think that’ll be true</p>

<p>Gentle lines and lullabies
A solemn message disguised as a lie
Push me away, push me away
Let me stay, let me stay</p>
