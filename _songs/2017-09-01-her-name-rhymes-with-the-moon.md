Her name rhymes with the moon
Oceans crashing down just to see her swoon
She'll leave in one more day
I'll still love her all the same
Taken miles apart
Fake this smile through a broken heart
Her name rhymes with the moon
Rolling under this muggy afternoon
Rain drops warn me she's leaving soon

Well I'll hide right here in your breast
As a melancholy cloud approaches from the west
Till the next goodbye my dear
It may even be another year

She says I'm not the only one
There's a faceless name half the world away
I'll learn to love her yet
Put my money down place my bet
That she'll be back here with me
Till the next goodbye just you wait and see
Her name rhymes with the moon
Rolling under this muggy afternoon
Rain drops warn me she's leaving soon

Well I'll hide right here in your breast
As a melancholy cloud approaches from the west
Till the next goodbye my dear
It may even be another year
