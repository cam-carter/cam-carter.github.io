Gentle lines and lullabies  
Bittersweet kisses and a slow goodbye  
Push me away, but let me stay  
All I want, all I need  
Something more, someone to please  
I'm beggin' you please

Hear what I have to say  
Try hard not to run away  
I see myself many years from now  
Lost in love I know you don't know how

If it takes so much to hear me say  
I'm sure I'll find a better way  
To tell you what you mean to me  
If I try to hard I'm scared you'll flee  
I'm beggin' you please

Hear what I have to say  
I'll try hard not to lose my way  
I see myself tomorrow still loving you  
I know it's hard to think that'll be true

Gentle lines and lullabies  
A solemn message disguised as a lie  
Push me away, push me away  
Let me stay, let me stay
