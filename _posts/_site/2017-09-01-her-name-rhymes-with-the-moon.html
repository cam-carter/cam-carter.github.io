<p>Her name rhymes with the moon<br />
Oceans crashing down just to see her swoon<br />
She’ll leave in one more day<br />
I’ll still love her all the same<br />
Taken miles apart<br />
Fake this smile through a broken heart<br />
Her name rhymes with the moon<br />
Rolling under this muggy afternoon<br />
Rain drops warn me she’s leaving soon</p>

<p>Well I’ll hide right here in your breast<br />
As a melancholy cloud approaches from the west<br />
Till the next goodbye my dear<br />
It may even be another year</p>

<p>She says I’m not the only one<br />
There’s a faceless name half the world away<br />
I’ll learn to love her yet<br />
Put my money down place my bet<br />
That she’ll be back here with me<br />
Till the next goodbye just you wait and see<br />
Her name rhymes with the moon<br />
Rolling under this muggy afternoon<br />
Rain drops warn me she’s leaving soon</p>

<p>Well I’ll hide right here in your breast<br />
As a melancholy cloud approaches from the west<br />
Till the next goodbye my dear<br />
It may even be another year</p>
