<p>Gentle lines and lullabies<br />
Bittersweet kisses and a slow goodbye<br />
Push me away, but let me stay<br />
All I want, all I need<br />
Something more, someone to please<br />
I’m beggin’ you please</p>

<p>Hear what I have to say<br />
Try hard not to run away<br />
I see myself many years from now<br />
Lost in love I know you don’t know how</p>

<p>If it takes so much to hear me say<br />
I’m sure I’ll find a better way<br />
To tell you what you mean to me<br />
If I try to hard I’m scared you’ll flee<br />
I’m beggin’ you please</p>

<p>Hear what I have to say<br />
I’ll try hard not to lose my way<br />
I see myself tomorrow still loving you<br />
I know it’s hard to think that’ll be true</p>

<p>Gentle lines and lullabies<br />
A solemn message disguised as a lie<br />
Push me away, push me away<br />
Let me stay, let me stay</p>
