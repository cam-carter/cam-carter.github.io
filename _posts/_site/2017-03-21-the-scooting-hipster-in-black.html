<p>Is he on his way to a funeral? Can’t be. It’s twelve past 8. Who has a funeral that early in the morning? And I see him every day that time, so it defeats the hypothesis. Well come to think of it that might be a good time for one… Also he’s too happy. The only bit of white that flashes by are his ankles (even on a cold day), his speed-torn face, and a tooth-filled grin. I only ever see him going fast. Begs the question if he ever slows down.</p>

<p>He rides an electric scooter. I made the assumption that it’s electric because he comes whizzing around the corner as silent as death (and as fast). In the bike lane. A lane I assumed was for bikes. Another assumption. But he doesn’t care. Why should he? I know no one else does. I care though. My morning goes like this: I wake up get ready make coffee (black like the rider) leave and see him.</p>

<p>And when I see him, he doesn’t see me smile. When it’s cold out, he’ll have a black beanie and an extra layer of black clothes, but his ankles still show above his black shoes and black socks and just below his black pants. He should really wear a helmet.</p>

<p>I know sometimes that I’m going faster, but he’s the fastest thing I’ve ever seen.</p>
